# Protoscope JS runtime

I help with transforming JavaScript before runtime and mapping error stack traces to their original source lines. To rebuild me, run

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

Or run `./node_modules/.bin/webpack --watch` to automatically rebuild `dist/protoscope-bundle.js` whenever you change the source files.
