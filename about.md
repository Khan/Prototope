To be honest, we're still not sure how you found this project. That said:

Prototope is a project out of khan academy brought to you by a team at khan academy that includes [@andymatuschak](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/), [@nsfmc](https://twitter.com/nsfmc/), [@mayli](https://twitter.com/mayli/), and [@nefaurk](https://twitter.com/nefaurk/). Soon, the list will be much longer.

The point of prototope is to define a conceptual api for interactive sketches. The goal is to have a great api for playing with ideas as quickly as possible. Prototope currently targets iOS and has no political aspirations.
